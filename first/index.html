        I've seen Jesus play with flames in a lake of fire that I was standing in Met the devil in Seattle and spent 9 months inside the lions den 
        Met Buddha yet another time and he showed me a glowing light within 
        But I swear that God is there every time I glare in the eyes of my best friend 
        Says my son it's all been done and someday yer gonna wake up old and gray 
        So go and try to have some fun showing warmth to everyone 
        You meet and greet and cheat along the way..</p>

        <p class="text">There's a gateway in our mind that leads somewhere out there far beyond this plane 
        Where reptile aliens made of light cut you open and pull out all your pain 
        Tell me how you make illegal something that we all make in our brain 
        Some say you might go crazy but then again it might make you go sane</p
