						by the men who moil for gold;
						The Arctic trails have their secret tales
						That would make your blood run cold;
						The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,
						But the queerest they ever did see
						Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
						I cremated Sam McGee.</p>

						Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.
						He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;
						Though he'd often say in his homely way that "he'd sooner live in hell."</p>
